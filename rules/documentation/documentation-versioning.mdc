# Documentation Versioning Rule

## When This Rule Applies

This rule **automatically applies** when:
- Creating new documentation files (`.md`)
- Modifying existing documentation
- Changing document status (Draft → Active → Deprecated, etc.)
- Updating INDEX.md with document changes
- Archiving or superseding documents

---

## Core Principle

**All documentation files must have consistent versioning and clear status tracking.** This enables:
- Understanding document lifecycle stage
- Tracking when documents were superseded or deprecated
- Finding replacement documents easily
- Maintaining accurate INDEX.md records

**Reference:** For general version management rules (rules, commands, standards, checklists), see `.cursor/rules/core/version-management.mdc`. This rule extends those concepts specifically for documentation files.

---

## Version Format for Documentation

### Standard Format

**Documentation Files:** `X.Y` (two-part versioning)

**When to Increment:**
- **Major (X):** Complete rewrite, structural reorganization, or breaking changes
- **Minor (Y):** New sections, significant updates, or meaningful additions

**Examples:**
- Initial creation: `1.0`
- Added new section: `1.1`
- Major rewrite: `2.0`
- Clarifications: `1.2`

### Version in Metadata (NOT Filenames)

**CORRECT:**
```markdown
# API Reference Guide

## Metadata
- **Version:** 1.2
- **Last Updated:** 12-09-2025 12:00:00 EST
```

**INCORRECT:**
```markdown
# File named: api_reference_v1_2.md  ❌ NO VERSION IN FILENAME
```

**Why:** Version in filenames causes broken links when version changes. Keep version in metadata only.

## Document Status Lifecycle

### Complete Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning | When to Use | Typical Duration |
|--------|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Planning** | Document concept is being scoped and planned | Initial idea phase, gathering requirements | Days to weeks |
| **In Roadmap** | Document is planned for future creation | Scheduled but not started | Weeks to months |
| **Draft** | Document is being actively written | Content incomplete, work in progress | Days to weeks |
| **In Review** | Document complete, awaiting review/approval | Ready for feedback, pending approval | Days |
| **Active** | Current, maintained, and in use | Primary documentation for topic | Months to years |
| **In Progress** | Active document being implemented | Document contents being built into application | Weeks to months |
| **Deprecated** | Still valid but use alternative | Newer approach exists, grace period | 30-90 days |
| **Superseded** | Replaced by newer version | New document completely replaces this one | 30-90 days |
| **Archived** | Historical reference only | No longer relevant, kept for history | Permanent |

### Detailed Status Descriptions

#### Planning
**Definition:** The document concept is being planned. Scope, audience, and content outline are being determined.

## Status Transitions

### Valid Status Flows

```
Planning → In Roadmap → Draft → In Review → Active
                                              ↓
                         In Progress ←────────┘
                              ↓
                           Active
                              ↓
                    ┌─────────┴─────────┐
                    ↓                   ↓
              Deprecated           Superseded
                    ↓                   ↓
                    └─────────┬─────────┘
                              ↓
                          Archived
```

### Invalid Transitions

- ❌ `Archived` → Any other status (archived is final)
- ❌ `Draft` → `Archived` (must go through Active first)
- ❌ `Planning` → `Active` (must go through Draft and Review)

### Transition Checklist

When changing status:

- [ ] Update `Status` field in metadata
- [ ] Add date field for new status (e.g., `Deprecated Date:`)
- [ ] Add reason field if applicable
- [ ] Add link to replacement if Superseded
- [ ] Add notice banner at top if Deprecated/Superseded
- [ ] Update INDEX.md with status change
- [ ] Update `Last Updated` timestamp
- [ ] Increment version number

---

## INDEX.md Maintenance

### When to Update INDEX.md

**ALWAYS update INDEX.md when:**
- Creating a new document
- Changing a document's status
- Renaming or moving a document
- Archiving a document
- Creating a new subdirectory

### INDEX.md Structure Requirements

Every `/docs/INDEX.md` should include:

#### 1. Document Status Changes Section

Track all status changes for audit trail:

```markdown
## Document Status Changes

| Date | Document | Previous Status | New Status | Reason | By |
|------|----------|-----------------|------------|--------|-----|
| 12-09-2025 | api_v1_reference.md | Active | Superseded | v2 released | @developer |
| 12-01-2025 | old_guide.md | Deprecated | Archived | Grace period ended | @developer |
| 11-15-2025 | new_feature.md | Draft | In Review | Ready for review | @developer |
```

#### 2. Recently Updated Section

```markdown
## Recently Updated (Last 30 Days)

| Document | Updated | Version | Status |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| [API Reference](./api/API_REFERENCE.md) | 12-09-2025 | 2.1 | Active |
| [Setup Guide](./getting-started/SETUP.md) | 12-05-2025 | 1.3 | Active |
```

#### 3. Documents by Status Section

```markdown
## Documents by Status

### Active Documents
- [Document 1](./path/doc1.md) - Description
- [Document 2](./path/doc2.md) - Description

### In Progress (Being Implemented)
- [Feature Spec](./specs/feature.md) - Implementation started 12-01-2025

### Draft Documents
- [New Guide](./guides/new.md) - ETA: 12-15-2025

### Deprecated/Superseded (Pending Archive)
| Document | Status | Replacement | Archive Date |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| [Old API](./api/old.md) | Superseded | [New API](./api/new.md) | 01-15-2026 |
```

### INDEX.md Update Checklist

When modifying INDEX.md:

- [ ] Add/update entry in main document listing
- [ ] Update "Recently Updated" section if within 30 days
- [ ] Add entry to "Document Status Changes" if status changed
- [ ] Update "Documents by Status" section
- [ ] Increment INDEX.md version
- [ ] Update INDEX.md "Last Updated" timestamp

---

## File Naming for Version Changes

### When Creating New Versions

**DO NOT create versioned filenames:**
```
❌ api_reference_v1.md
❌ api_reference_v2.md
```

**DO create new document and supersede old:**
```
✅ api_reference.md (v2.0 in metadata)
✅ api_reference_legacy.md (Superseded, archived later)
```

**Or use descriptive names:**
```
✅ api_reference_rest.md (REST API)
✅ api_reference_graphql.md (GraphQL API)
```

### Archive Naming Convention

When archiving, append `_archived_YYYY-MM-DD`:
- Original: `api_reference.md`
- Archived: `archive/api_reference_archived_2025-12-09.md`

---

## Integration with Other Rules

### documentation-metadata.mdc
- This rule defines STATUS options and requirements
- That rule defines overall metadata structure
- Both work together for complete metadata

### documentation-dependency-tracking.mdc
- When superseding, update dependencies in both old and new docs
- Old doc should reference new doc
- New doc may reference old for historical context

### core/version-management.mdc
- That rule covers all file types
- This rule extends it specifically for .md documentation
- Both use semantic versioning principles

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Superseding a Document

**Old Document (`api_v1_guide.md`):**
```markdown
# API v1 Guide

> ⚠️ **SUPERSEDED:** This document was superseded on 12-09-2025.
> **Replaced By:** [API v2 Guide](./api_v2_guide.md)
> **Reason:** Version 2.0 of the API released with breaking changes.
> **Archive Date:** This document will be archived on 03-09-2026.

## Metadata
- **Status:** Superseded
- **Superseded Date:** 12-09-2025
- **Superseded By:** [API v2 Guide](./api_v2_guide.md)
- **Superseded Reason:** API v2.0 released with new authentication model
- **Archive Date:** 03-09-2026
- **Version:** 1.5
- **Last Updated:** 12-09-2025 12:00:00 EST
```

### Example 2: Deprecating a Document

**Deprecated Document:**
```markdown
# Legacy Authentication Guide

> ⚠️ **DEPRECATED:** This document is deprecated as of 12-01-2025.
> **Reason:** New OAuth 2.0 flow supersedes this approach.
> **Use Instead:** [OAuth 2.0 Authentication](./auth/oauth2.md)
> **Archive Date:** This document will be archived on 03-01-2026.

## Metadata
- **Status:** Deprecated
- **Deprecated Date:** 12-01-2025
- **Deprecated Reason:** OAuth 2.0 provides better security and UX
- **Alternative:** [OAuth 2.0 Authentication](./auth/oauth2.md)
- **Archive Date:** 03-01-2026
- **Version:** 2.3
- **Last Updated:** 12-01-2025 10:00:00 EST
```

### Example 3: In Progress Document

## How to Use This Rule

**This rule applies automatically when creating or modifying documentation files.**

**Agents should:**
1. Use `X.Y` version format in metadata (never in filenames)
2. Set appropriate status based on document lifecycle
3. Include all required status-specific metadata fields
4. Add notice banners for Deprecated/Superseded documents
5. Link to replacement documents when superseding
6. Update INDEX.md on any status change
7. Maintain Document Status Changes table in INDEX.md
8. Follow status transition rules (no invalid transitions)
9. Plan archive dates for deprecated/superseded docs (30-90 days)

**Quick Status Reference:**
- **Planning/In Roadmap/Draft** → Document being prepared
- **In Review** → Ready for approval
- **Active** → Use this document
- **In Progress** → Document contents being built in app
- **Deprecated** → Use alternative, still works
- **Superseded** → Use replacement, this is old version
- **Archived** → Historical only, don't use

---

*This rule ensures consistent versioning and status management for all documentation, enabling clear lifecycle tracking and easy navigation to current, relevant documents.*
