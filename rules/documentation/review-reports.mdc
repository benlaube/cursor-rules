# Review Reports Rule

## When This Rule Applies

This rule **automatically applies** when:
- User says "review" in a prompt (e.g., "review this code", "review the architecture")
- A review command is executed
- The AI performs code review, PR review, or documentation review
- Creating any document that reports review findings

---

## Core Principle

**All review reports must be saved in a consistent location with standardized naming and structure.** This ensures:
- Trackable review history
- Consistent feedback format
- Easy reference for follow-ups
- Clear documentation of decisions

---

## Storage Location

### Required Location

**All review reports MUST be saved to:**
```
docs/_reports/reviews/
```

### Folder Structure

```
docs/
└── _reports/
    └── reviews/
        ├── README.md                           # Index of all reviews
        ├── code_review_2025-12-09.md           # Code review
        ├── architecture_review_2025-12-09.md   # Architecture review
        ├── pr_review_2025-12-09_pr123.md       # PR-specific review
        ├── documentation_review_2025-12-01.md  # Documentation review
        └── security_review_2025-11-15.md       # Security-focused review
```

---

## Naming Convention

### Required Format

```

**Components:**
- `{review_type}` - Type of review in `snake_case`
- `_review_` - Literal string (required)
- `{YYYY-MM-DD}` - Date of review
- `[_context]` - Optional context (e.g., PR number, feature name)

## Agent Behavior

### When User Requests Review

1. Determine review type from context
2. Conduct review using appropriate criteria
3. Create report using template above
4. Save to `docs/_reports/reviews/{type}_review_{date}.md`
5. Update `docs/_reports/reviews/README.md` index
6. Report completion to user with link and summary

### Quick Reviews vs Full Reviews

**Quick Review (no formal report):**
- Brief feedback in chat
- No persistent documentation needed
- User just wants quick opinion

**Full Review (formal report):**
- User says "create a review", "document review", "formal review"
- Part of PR process
- Needs to be referenced later
- Compliance/audit requirement

---

- [ ] Executive summary present
- [ ] Clear decision (Approved/Changes/Rejected)
- [ ] Findings categorized (positive/suggestions/required/blocking)
- [ ] Metadata complete

## How to Use This Rule

**This rule applies when creating any review report.**

**Agents should:**
1. Save all review reports to `docs/_reports/reviews/`

3. Follow the required template structure
4. Categorize findings clearly
5. Provide clear decision (Approved/Changes/Rejected)
6. Update the review index README.md

**Trigger words:**

- "evaluate", "assess", "analyze" (in review context)
- Review command execution
