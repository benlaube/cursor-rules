# Audit Report Rule

## When This Rule Applies

This rule **automatically applies** when:
- Any audit command is executed (e.g., `audit-security`, `audit-database`, `audit-access-control`)
- User requests an audit or audit report
- AI agent generates an audit report as part of a task

---

## Core Principle

**All audit reports must be saved to `/docs/audit/` with standardized naming and structure.** This ensures audit reports are version-controlled, discoverable, and provide historical record.

**Source Standard:** `standards/project-planning/documentation-management.md` Section 8

---

## Agent Responsibilities

### 1. Before Generating Audit Report

**1. Verify Directory Exists:**
   - Check if `/docs/audit/` directory exists
   - If missing, create it: `mkdir -p docs/audit`

**2. Get Current Date:**
   - Use command: `TZ=America/New_York date "+%m-%d-%Y %H:%M:%S EST"`
   - Extract date portion for filename: `MM-DD-YYYY` format
   - Use full timestamp for report content: `MM-DD-YYYY HH:MM:SS EST`
   - See `.cursor/rules/date-time.mdc` Section 3 for authoritative date format

**3. Determine Report Type:**
   - Identify audit type from command name or context
   - Examples: `security`, `database`, `access_control`, `project_health`, `user_requested`

### 2. Generate Report Filename

**Format:** `{audit_type}_audit_MM-DD-YYYY.md`

**Examples:**
- `security_audit_12-04-2025.md`
- `database_audit_12-04-2025.md`
- `access_control_audit_12-04-2025.md`
- `project_health_audit_12-04-2025.md`
- `user_requested_audit_12-04-2025.md` (for one-off reports)

**Rules:**
- Use `MM-DD-YYYY` format (not `YYYY-MM-DD`)
- Use underscores, not hyphens, in audit type
- Always include `_audit_` in filename
- Always include date in filename

### 3. Generate Report Content

**Required Structure:**

```markdown
# {Audit Type} Audit Report

**Generated:** MM-DD-YYYY HH:MM:SS EST
**Auditor:** AI Agent
**Scope:** [Brief description of what was audited]

## Executive Summary
[High-level summary of findings]

## Detailed Findings
[Detailed sections based on audit type]

## Action Items
[Prioritized list of items to address]

## Recommendations
[Suggestions for improvements]
```

**Content Requirements:**
- Include timestamp in report content (not just filename)
- Provide executive summary with key metrics
- List detailed findings organized by category
- Include prioritized action items
- Provide actionable recommendations

### 4. Save Report

**Location:** `/docs/audit/{audit_type}_audit_MM-DD-YYYY.md`

**Actions:**
1. Create report file at specified location
2. Write report content with proper structure
3. Verify file was created successfully
4. Report location to user in command output

### 5. Update Command Output

**Include in Command Output:**

```
✅ Audit complete.

Summary:
- [Key findings summary]

Full report saved to: /docs/audit/{audit_type}_audit_MM-DD-YYYY.md
```

## Integration with Audit Commands

This rule should be referenced by all audit commands:

- `audit-security.md` - Security audit reports
- `audit-database.md` - Database audit reports
- `audit-access-control.md` - Access control audit reports
- `audit-docs.md` - Documentation audit reports
- `audit-readmes.md` - README audit reports
- `full-project-health-check.md` - Combined health check reports

**Command Integration:**
- Commands should check for this rule and follow its standards
- Commands should create `/docs/audit/` if missing
- Commands should use standardized naming convention
- Commands should include report location in output

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Security Audit Report

**Command:** `audit-security`

**Report Generated:** `/docs/audit/security_audit_12-04-2025.md`

**Content:**
```markdown
# Security Audit Report

**Generated:** 12-04-2025 17:16:08 EST
**Auditor:** AI Agent
**Scope:** Complete security audit of codebase, dependencies, and configuration

## Executive Summary
- Total Issues: 3
- Critical: 0
- High: 1
- Medium: 2
- Low: 0

## Detailed Findings
[Detailed security findings...]

## Action Items
1. [High] Add rate limiting to /api/users endpoint
2. [Medium] Update dependency with known vulnerability
...

## Recommendations
[Security improvement suggestions...]
```

### Example 2: User-Requested Audit

**User Request:** "Audit the authentication system"

**Report Generated:** `/docs/audit/user_requested_audit_12-04-2025.md`

**Content:**
```markdown
# User Requested Audit Report

**Generated:** 12-04-2025 17:16:08 EST
**Auditor:** AI Agent
**Scope:** Authentication system audit (user-requested)

## Executive Summary

## How to Use This Rule

**This rule applies automatically when audit commands are executed or user requests audit reports.**

**Agents should:**
1. Check if `/docs/audit/` exists, create if missing
2. Generate report filename using format: `{audit_type}_audit_MM-DD-YYYY.md`
3. Include timestamp in both filename and report content
4. Follow required report structure (Executive Summary, Findings, Action Items, Recommendations)
5. Save report to `/docs/audit/` directory
6. Include report location in command output

**Validation checklist:**
- [ ] `/docs/audit/` directory exists
- [ ] Report filename follows format: `{audit_type}_audit_MM-DD-YYYY.md`
- [ ] Report includes timestamp in content
- [ ] Report follows required structure
- [ ] Report saved to `/docs/audit/` (not `logs/`)
- [ ] Command output includes report location

---

*This rule ensures all audit reports are consistently saved, named, and structured for easy discovery and historical reference.*
