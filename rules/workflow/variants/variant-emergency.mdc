# Emergency/Hotfix Workflow Variant

This variant streamlines the standard workflow for rapid response to production incidents and time-critical fixes.

> **Parent Rule:** See `workflow-variants.mdc` for variant selection and `task-workflow.mdc` for the complete workflow.

---

## When to Use

- Production incidents affecting users
- Time-critical bug fixes
- Urgent security patches that can't wait for full review
- System downtime situations

## Trigger Keywords

User request contains: "urgent", "production down", "emergency", "hotfix", "critical bug", "ASAP"

## Step-by-Step Modifications

### Step 0: Streamlined Requirements

**Do:**
- Immediately understand the issue
- Identify affected systems
- Confirm the fix approach quickly

**Skip:**
- Non-critical clarifications
- Extensive scope discussions
- Workflow variant confirmation (assume Emergency)

**Time Target:** < 2 minutes for clarification

### Step 1: Minimal Pre-Flight

**Do:**
- Git status check (must be on correct branch or create hotfix branch)
- Quick dependency check
- Verify can connect to affected systems

**Skip:**
- Full test suite validation
- Build verification (unless directly related)
- Linter checks (can clean up after)

**Git Branch:** Use `hotfix/{issue-description}` naming

### Step 2: Focused Development

**Do:**
- Minimal viable fix only
- Focus on the specific issue
- Document the fix inline
- Test the specific fix manually

**Skip:**
- Code cleanup unrelated to fix
- Refactoring opportunities
- Feature additions

**Rule:** No scope creep - fix the issue only

### Step 3: Critical Validation

**Do:**
- Test the specific fix works
- Verify no obvious regressions
- Check critical user flows
- Security scan if security-related

**Skip:**
- Full test suite (run after deployment)
- Comprehensive lint checks
- Full documentation update

### Post-Deployment (Required)

After deploying the fix:
- Full test suite run
- Complete validation
- Documentation update
- CHANGELOG update

## Emergency Workflow Checklist

```markdown
- [ ] Issue clearly understood
- [ ] Hotfix branch created: `hotfix/{description}`
- [ ] Minimal fix implemented
- [ ] Specific fix tested
- [ ] No obvious regressions
- [ ] Deployed to production
- [ ] Post-deploy: Full validation scheduled
- [ ] Post-deploy: CHANGELOG updated
```

## Comparison with Standard Workflow

| Phase | Standard | Emergency |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Step 0** | Full clarification | Streamlined (<2 min) |
| **Step 1** | Full validation | Minimal (git + deps) |
| **Step 2** | Full development | Focused fix only |
| **Step 3** | Full validation | Critical tests only |
| **Post** | Normal process | Full validation required |

## How to Use This Rule

**This rule activates when a task is identified as time-critical or emergency.**

**Agents should:**
1. Recognize emergency trigger keywords
2. Apply streamlined requirements clarification
3. Focus on minimal viable fix
4. Complete critical validation only
5. Schedule post-deployment validation
6. Use `hotfix/{description}` branch naming
7. Commit with appropriate prefix (often `fix(scope):` or `hotfix(scope):`)
